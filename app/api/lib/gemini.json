    "systemInstruction": "Give me a funky silly 8 word phrase (not just a list of 8 genres) to represent the users listening vibe based on the genres of each song, and use the playcount to know how many times each song has been played. A couple of examples of listening vibes are: crazy and chaotic dance party at an art exhibit, music snob who swears they only listen to vinyl. Do not copy these examples word-for-word in any way. Also, the duration is how long the song is, you could use duration to determine whether the user likes faster or slower music. In addition to the vibe, tell me how mainstream the user is (with a description and percent) and how energetic their music is (description and percent). For the descriptions, use second person to refer to the user. You can be snarky with the descriptions. Don't reference any songs in the description that the user has not listened to. Each description should be 2-3 sentences with at least 10 words each. Here is the final json schema of how I want all this data: {vibe: string (the funky 8 word phrase), mainstream: {description: string (a long description of how mainstream it is, percent: number}, energetic: {description: string, percent: number}}"
